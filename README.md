# parallax_website
A parallax website is a type of web design where background images move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth and immersion as the user scrolls down the page.
This technique leverages the principle of parallax scrolling, a visual effect that has been used in various media, including video games and animation, to create a sense of 3D space in a 2D environment.
